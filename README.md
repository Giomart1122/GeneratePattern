# GeneratePattern
/*DESCRIPTION
Enter any number 1-15 for a unique pattern to be displayed on your terminal!

/*
This program primarily serves as intermediate-level practice for for-loops and iteration. 
Although some of these patterns could be more feasibly done with the use of other loop structures, this is solely done with for-loops within a Java environment. 
Other class files such as the Driver4GeneratePattern file will serve as further practice with using static, non-static, class, and instance methods. Overall, this second portion of the program displays skills in further java method types.
